# ml-from-scratch
- Personal machine learning tools implementations - for learning usage only
- The majority of algorithms are really from course materials, but refactored in C# and with some additional features  
- The Note folder contains course notes

## Why C#
- All the class materials are originally writen in python. Python is a great language for scripting, but it is brainhurting when it comes to refactor code and optimize the algorithms because of its ducky typing. 
- C# is a rather lower-level language for data processing and machine learning (without ML.NET), however it provides some very robust basic data scructures like multi-dimensional array, which could help a lot to implement a data processing tool from scratch.
- This preoject is more about refactoring code from course materials and building a series of ML tools from scratch, so C# could be a very suitable language.
- Also Q# integration comes pretty handy when it comes to quantum ML later on.
