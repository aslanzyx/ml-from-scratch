# ml-from-scratch
personal machine learning tools implementations - for learning usage


## What has been done:
- Classification using decision trees
- Gradient tools
## TODO
- Refector in C#: data module deleted and to be implemented later
- Dynamic programming build within fit functions
- Build decision trees by minimizing entropy
